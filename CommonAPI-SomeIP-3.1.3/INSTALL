=== vsomeip

In order to build the CommonAPI SOME/IP Runtime library the vsomeip library must be available on your system. Please consult the vsomeip documentation for informations on building vsomeip.

=== Build CommonAPI-SomeIP Runtime

Use CMake to build the CommonAPI SOME/IP runtime library. We assume that your source directory is common-api-someip-runtime:

----
$ cd common-api-someip-runtime
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -D USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI=ON -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
$ make
$ make install
----

You can change the installation directory by the CMake variable +CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+ or you can let it uninstalled (skip the +make install+ command). If you want to use the uninstalled version of CommonAPI set the CMake variable USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI to OFF.

For further build instructions (build for windows, build documentation, tests etc.) please refer to the CommonAPI SOME/IP tutorial.
